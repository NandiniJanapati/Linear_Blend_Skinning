This was the second assignment I completed for my Computer Animation class at Texas A&M
The goal was to use linear blend skinning to animate a charater mesh with given animation data.

'z' toggles wireframe mode
spacebar plays the animation

When the Big Vegas model is loaded (use ../data for input argument), you can change the texture on th face to change his facial features.
e Move the eye texture coordinates horizontally within the texture
E Move the eye texture coordinates vertically within the texture
m Move the mouth texture coordinates horizontally within the texture
M Move the mouth texture coordinates vertically within the texture
b Move the brow texture coordinates vertically within the texture
